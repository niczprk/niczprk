- 👋 Hi, I’m @niczprk. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia
- 👀 I’m interested in creating simulations based off of observational data, in all wavelengths, to model any proposed
  theories and try to distinguish the good from the great! I would love to even propose my own at some point.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Physics and Astronomy with my main goal being to study galaxies and their evolution.
  I find space and the physics regarding astronomical objects to be fascinating and am always excited to learn whenever I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on personal projects that have a basis in research and can improve my capabilities!
