- 👋 Hi, I’m Nic Zaparniuk. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia
- 👀 I’m interested in creating simulations based off of observational data, in all wavelengths, to model any proposed
  theories and try to distinguish the good from the great! I would love to even propose my own at some point.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Physics and Astronomy with my primary interest being the study of galaxies and galaxy clusters.
  I am primarily focused in observational cosmology and looking at the evolution of large scale structure formation/evolution.
  My research has been conducted largely by utilizing the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and combining multiwavelength data to study how the ICM/IGM is evolving through high energy events.
  I find the physics behind astronomical objects to be fascinating and am always excited to learn whenever I can.
- 💞️ I am currently working at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute as an observational cosmologist.
